### HAL 9000

![Concept](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/743b5761-07d7-4fdc-ab48-21d16afffb0c)

Creating a replica of the HAL 9000, the infamous AI from 2001: A Space Odyssey, has become a popular project among IoT enthusiasts. These projects typically aim to emulate HAL's iconic design, voice interaction, and intelligent functionalities, while often using IoT components to enhance interactivity and connectivity. At the core, a HAL 9000 replica usually features a sleek, circular red lens for visual appeal, often embedded with LED lights, and can integrate a microphone and speaker for audio input and output. Using platforms like Raspberry Pi or Arduino, builders can program their HAL replica to respond to voice commands, control smart home devices, and interact with users. Some projects even integrate Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant to replicate HAL's voice responsiveness, enabling the device to perform tasks like playing music, answering questions, or controlling lights in true sci-fi style.

In more advanced IoT HAL 9000 projects, the replicas go beyond simple voice recognition and extend to smart home automation and advanced AI functionalities. Enthusiasts often connect their HAL replicas to various IoT-enabled devices, such as smart thermostats, security cameras, and lighting systems, allowing HAL to become the central hub for home automation. These projects might incorporate machine learning libraries and cloud services, giving the device a form of "learning" ability to adapt to user preferences over time. Developers also experiment with speech synthesis software to recreate HAL’s unique, calm voice, providing an authentic feel. As a result, these IoT HAL 9000 replicas offer both an engaging homage to the fictional AI and a practical, interactive tool for controlling modern smart home environments.

### Electronic Smarties Candy Dispenser Concept

![Electronic Smarties Candy Dispenser Concept](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e78a78b3-43fa-4283-9f31-28c520d0f2ae)

This Arduino Smartie Candy Dispenser concept involves a system where a gravity-weighted suction tube mechanism is employed to pick up individual Smarties from a hopper. Each Smartie is moved through pneumatic suction to the dispenser, where the tube gradually lowers further into the center of the hopper as it picks up one candy at a time. The suction tube intake is designed to hold a single Smartie per operation, with flaps in place that control the candy's movement. Once a Smartie is inside the tube head, a flap closes behind it to secure the candy, and another flap opens in front, allowing the candy to continue its journey to the dispenser via suction.

The dispenser concept includes several features aimed at enhancing user experience. It operates contactlessly, counting every candy dispensed and displaying the count on an OLED screen, which shows the total candy count and total candy dispensed. The device can dispense candy using an NFC smartphone app or card, and it includes LED lights for additional visual feedback. Powered by a USB-A input, the dispenser design is intended to be interactive, providing users with a fun, automated way to enjoy candy while offering useful metrics about candy consumption.

### Pi to SD Card Port

![Hacked](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2406dc62-834b-4fdf-83a9-50ad664bcc20)

To connect an SD card to the Raspberry Pi through GPIO, you can hack the setup using SPI mode, a protocol that the Pi’s GPIO pins support. This approach bypasses the usual SD card slot on the Pi, instead connecting directly to the Pi’s GPIO pins to transfer data in SPI mode. Typically, SD cards operate in SD mode, which is faster and more complex, but they can also communicate over the simpler SPI protocol. While SPI is slower, it allows the Pi to interact with the SD card using GPIO, enabling basic read/write operations and providing an alternative means of accessing SD storage for certain low-speed applications.

The SD card adapter cable you shared can be useful for this type of setup, as it gives more physical flexibility in positioning the SD card and provides accessible wiring for tapping into the SD card’s pins. By connecting this extender cable to the Pi’s GPIO pins, you can effectively relocate the SD card interface, allowing for easier experimentation with SD card signals without modifying the Pi’s onboard slot. The adapter cable helps expose individual SD card lines (such as CLK, CMD, and DAT) so that they can be easily connected to the appropriate GPIO pins on the Pi configured for SPI communication.

To set up the connection, you would wire the adapter cable’s pins to specific GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi: the MOSI (Master Out Slave In) line on the Pi’s SPI interface connects to the Data In (DI) pin on the SD card, MISO (Master In Slave Out) to Data Out (DO), SCLK (Serial Clock) to the Clock (CLK) pin, and a GPIO pin as the Chip Select (CS). This setup allows the Pi to control data flow through the SD card adapter cable, though you may need additional pull-up resistors to ensure stable signals. Once physically connected, you’d need to enable SPI on the Pi and use a programming library (such as Python’s spidev) to send and receive data, implementing the necessary command structure to read from or write to the SD card.

While possible, this hack has limitations. SPI mode is slower than full SD mode, which means data transfer speeds are reduced—making it suitable only for low-bandwidth applications like basic data logging or educational experimentation. Additionally, the setup requires a good understanding of both SD card protocols and electronics, as well as care with wiring to avoid signal integrity issues. This hack offers a unique way to use the Pi’s GPIO to manage SD card communication, leveraging the adapter cable as a flexible bridge, but it requires significant effort and technical knowledge to implement effectively. For more reliable and faster solutions, a USB-to-SD card adapter is generally preferable, though this GPIO-to-SD card hack can be an interesting project for those looking to explore custom interfacing with SD cards.
