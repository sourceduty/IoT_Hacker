Smoke E-Grenade IoT Device Plan

Objective

Create an IoT-enabled smoke-emitting device ("Smoke E-Grenade") capable of remote activation using a microcontroller, specifically for controlled environments and testing purposes. The device will be powered by a battery and use a relay or MOSFET for triggering the smoke emission.

Components Needed

1. Smoke Emission Component
   - Commercial smoke cartridge OR a custom smoke generator using glycerin and a heating coil.
2. Microcontroller
   - ESP8266 or ESP32 (for Wi-Fi control and ease of programming).
3. Connectivity Options
   - Wi-Fi: Use for medium-to-long-range control.
   - Optional: Bluetooth module for short-range control if desired.
4. Power Source
   - Lithium-Ion battery (e.g., 18650) with a charging module (such as TP4056).
5. Activation Mechanism
   - 5V Relay module (for commercial smoke cartridge).
   - MOSFET (for custom smoke generation with a heating element).
6. Enclosure and Safety
   - Heat-resistant casing to protect the components.
   - Proper ventilation to avoid overheating during operation.

Step-by-Step Guide

Step 1: Hardware Setup

   1. Prepare the Microcontroller
      - Set up the ESP8266 or ESP32 microcontroller.
      - Connect it to your computer and install the Arduino IDE, with the necessary libraries for ESP8266 or ESP32.
   
   2. Relay/MOSFET Wiring
      - If using a relay: Connect the relay module's control pin to a digital GPIO pin on the microcontroller (e.g., D1 on ESP8266).
      - If using a MOSFET: Connect the gate to a GPIO pin on the microcontroller.
      - Connect the source pin of the MOSFET to ground and the drain to the negative side of the heating element (or smoke cartridge) power circuit.
   
   3. Connect the Power Source
      - Connect the positive end of the battery to the VCC pin on the microcontroller and the relay/MOSFET setup.
      - Ensure a common ground between the microcontroller, relay/MOSFET, and power source.

Step 2: Software Setup

   1. Program the Microcontroller
      - Use the Arduino IDE to write a simple program for the ESP8266/ESP32 to control the relay or MOSFET based on remote commands.
      - Set up Wi-Fi connectivity with the ESP device, and create a basic web server to handle remote activation commands.
   
   2. Control Interface
      - For a web interface: Program a simple HTML interface hosted on the microcontroller's web server. This will allow for remote activation through any browser by sending commands to trigger the relay/MOSFET.
      - Alternatively, set up control via Bluetooth if applicable, and use a mobile app or Bluetooth terminal for command input.

Step 3: Testing and Safety

   1. Conduct Initial Tests
      - Test the circuit with a lower voltage before connecting the full power source to ensure proper operation.
      - Verify the web server setup and control interface can activate and deactivate the relay/MOSFET as expected.
   
   2. Safety Precautions
      - Perform tests in a well-ventilated, controlled environment.
      - Ensure the enclosure is properly ventilated and heat-resistant, especially around the smoke-emitting component.
   
   3. Final Test and Deployment
      - Connect the smoke-emitting component and perform final tests.
      - Make sure the device powers on, connects to Wi-Fi, and responds to commands consistently.
      - Deploy in a controlled environment, monitoring for overheating or potential safety hazards during operation.
